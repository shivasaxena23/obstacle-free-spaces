##### [Creating Navigable Space from Sparse Noisy Map Points](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01503.pdf)
- A framework for creating navigable space from sparse and noisy map points generated by SLAM methods with noisy sensors or poor features.
- To optimize the free space construction, instead of searching all obstacle map points to find the points closest to the ellipsoid as mentioned in the standard IRIS process, we opt to look for the points closest to the ellipsoid only among a set of nearest neighboring points. Namely, for each sampling point, we employ the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method in the filtered point cloud.
- The culling operation is performed for two adjacent convex hulls.
